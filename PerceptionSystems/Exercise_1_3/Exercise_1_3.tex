  \section{Exercise 3}
Go to the link \url{http://www.ptgrey.com/blackfly-09-mp-color-gige-vision-poe-sony-icx692-camera}, which is a digital camera from one of
the major camera brands used in robotics.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
    \item Try to understand the specs by drawing them in a sketch similar to that of slide 14.

    \begin{figure}[ht]

\item Using a Lense of 8mm ( \url{http://www.ptgrey.com/m12-micro-lens-8mm-3} ), How many pixels will represent the Mona Lisa painting
if it is situated at 1,2,5,10 m ? Draw a plot distance-pixels. (Mona Lisa dimensions are: 77cm x 53 cm, \url{https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Mona_Lisa} )

The proposed formula to solve this exercise should be divided in two: one for the horizontal pixels and one for the vertical pixels. We'll multiply them later to get the final amount of pixels needed to represent the Mona Lisa.

\begin{equation}
{horizontal\ pixels} = \dfrac {pixel\ width \times width\ of\ the\ Mona\ Lisa }{2 \times distance \times \tan{(0.5 \times horizontal\ angle)}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
{vertical\ pixels} = \dfrac {pixel\ height \times height\ of\ the\ Mona\ Lisa }{2 \times distance \times \tan{(0.5 \times vertical\ angle)}}
\end{equation}

Given these formulas, we can calculate how many pixels we need to represent the Mona Lisa:

\begin{itemize}
  \item At 1m, 1509 horizontal pixels x 1039 vertical pixels are needed.
  \item At 2m, 754 horizontal pixels x 519 vertical pixels are needed.
  \item At 5m, 301 horizontal pixels x 207 vertical pixels are needed.
  \item At 10m, 150 horizontal pixels x 103 vertical pixels are needed.
\end{itemize}

\item Why the proposed (linked) lense in b) could not be used easily with this camera ?

The proposed lens has an S-mount which has an M12 thread, whereas our camera can only use CS and C-mount lenses which have 1 inch threads.

\end{enumerate}
